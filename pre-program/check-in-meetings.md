# Check-in meetings

Overall, we are a very informal group. We don't have any standing team meetings or checkins. That said, we do stay informed and connected daily and weekly.

### Mentor

Occasional meeting will be schedule with your mentor for "official-ish" checkins. Make sure we are on target and moving in the right direction.

### Slack

We use Slack for daily communication and sharing. You will receive access to our Slack team on day one. We have a dedicated channel for the \#apprenticeship.

You are free to communicate, share, and ask questions in the \#apprenticeship room on Slack. 

You will also have direct PM access to your Mentor and the rest of the team.

## Conduct

In general,  good common sense conduct is expected. Thousands of words could be written about this, but just keep it kind, helpful, and considerate.

### How to Ask for Help

Feel free to ask for help or talk with someone at any time. You can do so through private messages or in the appropriate Slack channel. The best way to ping someone is by using their name, like this `@calebsylvest`.  If the person can't respond immediately be patient. Courtesy dictates a response to let the person know _when_ you will be available to reply in full. So, try to do so when someone pings you.
