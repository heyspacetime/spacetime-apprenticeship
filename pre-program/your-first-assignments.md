## You Need a Website

In Week 1, your first assignment will be to setup your personal, professional website. In this industry, an online portfolio is _the most_ important indicator of who you are, your capabilities, and whether someone is interested enough to talk to you when considering a job.

### Preparation

* [ ] **Domain**
  * Find a domain name for your website

    * **Something else**
